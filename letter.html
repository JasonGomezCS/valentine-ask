My love, mi cariño, my pretty girl,

Even with the distance between us, you still mean the absolute world to me. I hope you liked the little website I made for you  it’s just a small way of showing how often you’re on my mind and how much you truly mean to me every single day.

I love everything about you. Your warm brown eyes, your soft smile, and the way your cute glasses rest perfectly on your nose like they were made just for you. I love your laugh, your jokes, and even the way you get competitive or a little angry at games. Every small detail about you stays in my head longer than you probably realize.

Some of my favorite moments are the quiet ones when we’re on call together and neither of us is saying anything, but we both know we’re there. Those silences never feel empty; they feel comfortable, safe, and full at the same time. I love the times you tease me and I try to “rage bait” you back, the playful bullying, the random conversations, and all the tiny interactions that might seem small to anyone else but mean so much to me. The little moments with you aren’t little to me at all — they’re everything.

No matter how far apart we are, my heart always feels close to you. Distance doesn’t change what I feel; if anything, it reminds me how real it is. And even though words sometimes fall short, there’s something I want to say to you honestly and from the deepest place in my heart:

I love you, Kassandra.
More than I can fully explain, and more than I ever thought I could ever put into words.

Yours,
Jason 
  </p>
